# 03-CSS-Variables-JS
Exploring CSS Variable manipulation through JavaScript

Goal of this project: To create CSS variables that would then be manipulated via JS in order to make scope changes.

What I learned:

-Created HTML control elements with corresponding data attributes to be referenced as a dataset in JS. 

-Used CSS variables in order to have variables become changed from :root element by JS when documentElement style property is called.

-Used JS to select all input controls, added a listener for mousemove and change events & created a function to handle these events and make the corresponding values update the image object accordingly.
